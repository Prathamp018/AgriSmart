# AgriSmart 🌿
#### A basic ML and DL-based website that advises the best crop to produce depending on the climate and soil conditions.



## MOTIVATION 💪
One of the key industries that affects a nation's ability to prosper economically is farming. 

- The majority of people in a nation like India rely on agriculture as their primary source of income. In order to make farming simpler and to increase productivity, several new technologies are being incorporated into the industry, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 


- In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively. 

    - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow. 
    
    - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements. 
    
    - For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## DATA SOURCE 📊
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) (custom built dataset)


## DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC). The source of the data does not provide any guarantees. Therefore, don't use it to guide your farming selections. The designer won't be held accountable for anything if you do this. But this experiment offers a notion of how ML/DL may be used to precision farming if it is developed on a broad scale using real and validated data.

## How to use 💻
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. 
Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity, temperature data is fetched.

## How to run locally 🛠️
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system


- `deploy` branch has only the code required for deploying the app (rest of the code that was used for training the models, data preparation can be accessed on `master` branch)
- It is highly recommended to clone the deploy branch for running the project locally (the further steps apply only if you have the deploy branch cloned)
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n AgriSmart python=3.6.12
  conda activate AgriSmart
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.

## Usage ⚙️
You can use this project for further developing it and adding your work in it. If you use this project, kindly mention the original source of the project and mention the link of this repo in your report.

## Further Improvements 📈
This was my first big project so there are lot of things to improve upon

- CSS code is totally messed up :pensive: (some code in file and some inline)
- Frontend can be made more nicer (PS: I suck at frontend development) :cry:	
- More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more accurate :monocle_face:	
- Additional plant images can be collected to make the disease detection part more robust and generalized :face_with_head_bandage:
- Modularized code can be written instead of writing in Jupyter Notebooks (will follow this in upcoming projects)

and fertilizer recommendation part). This project is an extended version of the above mentioned project. Please star the mentioned repo.
